# JPACRUDProject
## How To Run
- Running this project starts from the website. You will be prompted to query a database by either selecting a film from a film id, or you can go and view the entire collection of films and edit/update/delete them along with creating your own cards in the collection
## Project Description
- This project was originally made to enter and input all of my pokemon cards that I collect so that I can organize them by sets, price, rarity, etc while maintaining a track record of their price as well. This project is just a singular table, with a few columns that are mostly comprised of var char inputs along with a double price, and a last_update that just puts the date & time the card was updated so that I can keep track of when I updated it
## Technologies Used
- The technologies used in this project are Spring Boot, Gradle, MySql, as well as some jakarta plug ins, and a little bit of bootstrap. This project is mostly run from the website as long as the user can launch it as it is not currently stand alone deployed
## Lessons Learned
- This project was a big stepping stone in terms of being able to organize my thoughts in a concise way, along with having a straight forward gameplan and really understanding the concepts behind everything. There were not very many moments in which I felt I was stuck, and naturally progressing through the project I was able to understand the flow of everything inside of it, and any problems that did occur were easily remedied. This was a huge confidence boost of a project
